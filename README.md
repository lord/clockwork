Clockwork
=========

Analytics and highscores server for GameMaker.

This is the source code for http://madewithclockwork.com, in case you wanted to host it yourself. The SQL structure you'll need for the database is in db_structure.sql.

This software uses CodeIgniter, which is documented here:

About
========
I built Clockwork freshmen year of high school, so it's rather...poorly written. It isn't really updated any more, since I've moved on to other things. This source code is here for posterity's sake.
